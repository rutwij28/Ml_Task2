NativeSoft Tec ML internship
This project uses the Titanic dataset to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on features such as age, sex, class, and embarked location. The dataset is from Kaggle's Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster competition. The model is built using supervised learning techniques, specifically Random Forest, and tuned for optimal performance using GridSearchCV.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to explore machine learning models and techniques for predicting passenger survival on the Titanic. The dataset includes both numerical and categorical features, such as:

Age: The age of the passenger
Sex: Gender of the passenger
Fare: The fare paid for the ticket
Embarked: The port where the passenger boarded the Titanic (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)
